# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction with LSTM

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict cryptocurrency prices.

## Note:
 - This project is currently getting reworked with the API key getting changed over using Python-Binance, an application programming interface that allows you to connect and interact with the Binance servers via the Python programming language.
 - This application will enable you to analyze, interact, and automate trading processes to try and reduce some of this volatility.


## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Visualization libraries: Matplotlib and seaborn.
- Finance libraries: mplfinance.
- Neural Network libraries: Tensorflow and Keras.
