# Binance BTC and ETH Prediction and Analysis

This project demonstrates how to connect to the Binance API, retrieve real-time data for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), perform data preprocessing and visualization, and create a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Binance account (to obtain API key and secret)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/binance-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd binance-prediction
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `config.ini` file in the project directory with your Binance API key and secret:

```ini
[binance]
api_key = your_api_key
api_secret = your_api_secret
```

## Usage

1. Open the `binance_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.

2. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the following steps:

   - Import necessary libraries
   - Configure and authenticate with the Binance API
   - Retrieve and preprocess historical data for BTC and ETH
   - Visualize the data using mplfinance
   - Create an LSTM predictive model
   - Test the model on a separate dataset
   - Plot the actual and predicted prices

## Files

- `binance_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code
- `config.ini`: Configuration file for storing Binance API key and secret (excluded from the repository)
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages
